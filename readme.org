* About

This is a prototype View Engine server as discussed during my talk at
KanDDDinsky conference in Berlin (october, 2017).

* Getting started

1. Launch view engine api by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
go run demo/main.go
#+END_SRC

2. Install web packages (preferrably via [[https://yarnpkg.com/en/][yarn]]) and launch web UI:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd web
yarn install
yarn start
#+END_SRC

Afterwards direct your browser at  [[http://localhost:3000][localhost:3000]].
